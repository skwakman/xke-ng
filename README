Welcome to the XKE-NG project.

This project is a study on the use of Android and REST services from a more
architectural point of view. But it is also meant for gaining knowledge in the
Android API and REST services in an enterprise way.

Basically it consists of the following components:
- Android front-end to browse through conference talks
- REST services to manage talks


There are three projects:

  1. XCoSS (Xebia Conference Scheduling System)
  2. aXCV (Xebia Conference Viewer for Android)
  3. iXCV (Xebia Conference Viewer for iPhone/iPad)

XCoSS is the server component with a web interface and REST services,
      based on XML and/or JSON.

aXCV  is the Android 2+ client for viewing and editing conference sessions.

iXCV  is currently not active, but will do the same as aXCV.
