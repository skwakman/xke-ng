Welcome to the XKE-NG project.

This project is a study on the use of Android and REST services from a more
architectural point of view. But it is also meant for gaining knowledge in the
Android API and REST services in an enterprise way.

Basically it consists of the following components:
- Android front-end to browse through conference talks
- REST services to manage talks

Database structure is not yet determined.
